Story of a misfortune...
============================

Me and Sylux had the original idea for the Artificial Intelligence course. 

Controls (and game in general) pretty much'd be like those seen in Fire Emblem Heroes.

Game was dismissed as -too difficult- by Babasbot and the project never saw the light.

Having dismissed our idea he propossed a Pokémon-Playing-AI. 

On a personal note, we got kinda mad at Babasbot and Korakos since they're really seasoned programmers but decided no to use their savvy on our idea, despite they were ditching classes...
